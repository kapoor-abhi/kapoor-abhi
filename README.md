## About Me

Hi, I'm Abhishek Kapoor — a Data Scientist.

I work at the intersection of data, machine learning, and intelligent systems. With 3+ years of hands-on experience, I’ve moved beyond theory and into building real-world, production-ready solutions through internships and advanced projects.

From statistical models to deep learning architectures and large language models (next-token predictors), I enjoy understanding systems from first principles and engineering them for reliability and impact.

I specialize in transforming raw, unstructured data into meaningful insights, scalable pipelines, and AI-driven applications that support real business decisions.

I believe in evidence over intuition, experiments over assumptions, and data over opinions.
